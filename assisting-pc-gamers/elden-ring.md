# Elden Ring - Common Issues & Solutions

## Technical Issues

### Crash on Startup
**Symptoms:** Game crashes immediately or shows white screen
**Solutions:**
1. Verify game files through Steam
2. Update graphics drivers (NVIDIA/AMD)
3. Disable Steam overlay
4. Run as administrator
5. Add exception to antivirus
6. Install Visual C++ Redistributables

### Performance Issues (Low FPS)
**Symptoms:** Stuttering, frame drops, especially in open world
**Solutions:**
1. Disable EasyAntiCheat overlay
2. Set shader cache to Unlimited in GPU settings
3. Disable Windows fullscreen optimizations
4. Lower graphics settings: Shadows and Volumetric Quality have biggest impact
5. Cap FPS to 60 (game engine tied to framerate)

### Multiplayer Connection Issues
**Symptoms:** Can't summon/invade, "Unable to summon cooperator"
**Solutions:**
1. Use password system for friends
2. Check NAT type (should be Open/Type 1)
3. Verify both players are in same area
4. Use Furlcalling Finger Remedy
5. Check level difference (large gaps prevent summoning)

## Progression Blocks

### Stuck After Godrick
**Common Issue:** Don't know where to go after Stormveil
**Solution:** 
- Go to Roundtable Hold, talk to NPCs
- Head to Liurnia of the Lakes (northwest exit from Stormveil)
- Academy of Raya Lucaria requires Glintstone Key (find at dragon corpse)

### Can't Enter Leyndell
**Requirements:**
- Need 2+ Great Runes activated
- Must defeat Draconic Tree Sentinel
- Alternative: Wrong Warp glitch (speedrun technique)

### Radahn Festival Not Starting
**Triggers:**
- Reach Altus Plateau
- OR complete Ranni's questline to Nokron
- OR exhaust dialogue with Blaidd/Alexander

## Boss Strategies

### Malenia Quick Tips
- Use Bloodhound Step for Waterfowl Dance
- Bleed/Frost builds very effective
- Stay close in Phase 2
- Summon placement matters (not too early)
- Practice parrying her normal attacks

### Fire Giant Tips
- Target left ankle (has splint) in Phase 1
- Use Torrent for mobility
- Phase 2: Stay under him, watch for fire attacks
- Alexander summon sign available if quest completed

### Elden Beast Tips
- Use Holy damage negation (Haligdrake Talisman +2)
- Physical damage better than magic
- Pest Threads incantation melts large bosses
- Stay medium range to avoid grab

## Quest Issues

### Ranni's Quest Stuck
**Common blocks:**
- Need to defeat Radahn first
- Talk to her at night in Ranni's Rise
- Find Fingerslayer Blade in Nokron
- Give blade to Ranni
- If she's gone, check Renna's Rise

### Millicent Quest Issues
- First location: Church of the Plague
- Need Unalloyed Gold Needle from O'Neil
- Prosthesis location: Shaded Castle
- Final choice affects rewards

### Alexander Stuck in Ground
