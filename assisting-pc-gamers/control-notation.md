## Timing and Rhythm

### Duration
```
"Tap [Space]" - Quick press
"Press [E]" - Normal press
"Hold [Shift] for 3 seconds" - Timed hold
"Hold [LMB] until bar fills" - Visual cue
"Rapidly tap [Space]" - QTE/multiple presses
```

### Sequence Timing
```
"Press [Space] then immediately [Shift]" - No delay
"Press [E], wait 1 second, press [Q]" - Timed delay
"After animation, press [Space]" - Visual cue
"On the third beep, press [E]" - Audio cue
```

### Rhythm Games
```
"Hit [D] [F] [J] [K] to the beat"
"Hold [Space] for long notes"
"Alternate [Z] and [X] rapidly"
```

## Accessibility Considerations

### Clear Instructions
```
Good: "Press [W] to move forward"
Bad: "Use movement key"

Good: "Hold [Shift] while pressing [W] to run"
Bad: "Sprint forward"

Good: "Click [LMB] on the enemy to attack"
Bad: "Attack the enemy"
```

### Alternative Options
```
Standard: "Rapidly tap [Space] to escape"
Alternative: "Or hold [X] if tap-rapid is enabled in settings"

Standard: "Use [Shift] + [WASD] to sprint"
Alternative: "Or toggle sprint with [Caps Lock]"
```

### Difficulty Modifiers
```
Easy mode: "Hold [E] to auto-target"
Normal mode: "Aim with [Mouse] then [LMB]"
Hard mode: "Must hit weakpoint with [RMB] then [LMB]"
```

## Platform Clarifications

### PC vs Console
Always specify PC controls:
```
"On PC: Press [Space] to jump"
(Not: "Press A/X button")

"Use [WASD] for movement"
(Not: "Use left stick")

"Aim with [Mouse]"
(Not: "Use right stick")
```

### Keyboard Layouts
Note when non-QWERTY matters:
```
"Press [Z] (or [Y] on QWERTZ keyboards)"
"Use [Q] and [A] (AZERTY users: [A] and [Q])"
```

## Special Situations

### Quick Time Events (QTE)
```
"When prompt appears, quickly press [E]"
"Spam [Space] when the bar appears"
"Match the sequence: [W], [A], [S], [D]"
```

### Combo Inputs
```
Light attack combo: [LMB], [LMB], [LMB]
Heavy combo: [Hold LMB], [RMB], [LMB]
Special: [RMB] + [LMB] simultaneously
Cancel: [Space] during attack animation
```

### Context-Sensitive
```
"Near ladder: [E] to climb"
"In water: [Space] to surface, [Ctrl] to dive"
"While aiming: [Scroll] to zoom"
"In vehicle: [Shift] for boost, [Space] for handbrake"
```

## Formatting Best Practices

### Do's
✓ Use brackets consistently: `[Key]`
✓ Capitalize letter keys: `[W]` not `[w]`
✓ Explain holds vs taps
✓ Number sequential steps
✓ Include timing when critical
✓ Specify mouse movement direction

### Don'ts
✗ Mix notation styles
✗ Use ambiguous terms ("action button")
✗ Assume key bindings without stating them
✗ Forget platform specification
✗ Use console terminology for PC

### Example: Complete Instruction
```
To perform a slide-jump attack:

1. Sprint forward with [Shift] + [W]
2. While sprinting, press [Ctrl] to slide
3. During slide, tap [Space] to jump
4. While airborne, click [LMB] for diving attack
5. Hold [S] just before landing to roll backwards

Timing: The [Space] must come within 0.5 seconds of sliding
